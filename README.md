# Synchronised-Stack-w-threads
The goal of this assignment was to make a thread safe stack that supports the commends "PUSH", "POP" and "TOP" with that complexity of O(1).  
Multiple clients can use the stack (that is on the server) using the standard input.

## About the Files
### stack.hpp and stack.cpp:
Contain the stack data stracture and methods.
### client.cpp:
The client side.
### server.cpp:
The server side.
### part5.cpp
Check the stack without using server, clients and multi-threads.
### part8.cpp:
Implementation of malloc, calloc and free.
### tests.cpp:
